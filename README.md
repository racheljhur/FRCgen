Available here are the python scripts and sve ensemble datasets used for the work detailed in Protocols for the Estimation of the EVDs of Stresses Driving Damage Initiation in Polymer Matrix Composites.

Each datapoint in sve_data.npy belongs to one of the 15 microstructural classes (described in the paper), where each class is comprised of SVE realizations sharing similar fiber clustering attributes and fiber volume fraction. The dictionary ranges_dict specifies which indices in sve_data.npy correspond to a specific class.
