Available here are the python scripts and sve ensemble datasets employed in the paper Protocols for the Estimation of the EVDs of Stresses Driving Damage Initiation in Polymer Matrix Composites.

Note that the sequence of strings and the numerical value (fiber volume fraction) are directly employed as generation parameters (e.g., FCCC_40 would generate an SVE with relatively close fiber clustering attributes). The dataset is organized by 15 microstructural classes, where each class is uniquely prescribed via common clustering attributes anf fiber volume fraction over SVE realizations comprising the class.
